## How to run
After you clone the repo from github please install dependencies by running `npm i` from within app's root directory in the terminal.

You will need tokens from dev.twitter.com in order to utilize the Twitter API.

I saved my tokens to config.js which I included in my .gitignore file in order to keep said tokens private.
